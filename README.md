# Modified Hate Meme Dataset

This project enhances the Hate Meme Dataset by incorporating more precise and context-aware captions, generated using ShareGPT-4. The modified dataset aims to improve the accuracy of models trained to recognize and classify hateful or offensive memes.

## Dataset Overview

The Modified Hate Meme Dataset is designed to provide more nuanced captions, offering deeper context for machine learning applications focused on meme classification and hate speech detection. These refined captions serve as an additional resource for building models capable of better understanding meme content.

### Caption Generation

For this dataset, ShareGPT-4 was used to generate captions that accurately capture the underlying themes and messaging of each meme. This augmentation enriches the dataset and improves its relevance for hate speech detection tasks.
